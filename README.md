Regular Expression to Remove Comments
---

## Notice:


__I have moved this repository to my 'professional' account.__

All content and licensing remains the same. It just seemed better to have one copy there rather than two copies from a fork, which would require double the maintenance. Though I expect there to be none, there's always _something_ that shows up.

The new home is:

[chindraba-work/comment_removal_double_slash](https://github.com/chindraba-work/comment_removal_double_slash)

I added "double_slash" to the title so that I can, later, rework the code for other comment styles, such as hash marks (`#`) INI style (`;`), etc.
